Data visualization coding of charts and graphs 

Introduction

Data consisted of a total of 1893 rows of data.  There were a total of 249 mice that were measured over a span of 45 days. Gender was equally represented in the data set.  Several drug regimens were examined to determine which controlled tumor volume most effectively.  

Methods

Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy were utilized within Jupiter Notebook in order to analyze the data.  The data set was cleaned and data visualizations created including bar plots, pie charts, and regression analysis. 

Results

After analysis different drug regimens did have different affects on tumor size.  Analysis was also performed to demonstrate a positive correlation between tumor size and mouse weight. 

Discussion/Conclusion

Capomulin and Ramican had the lowest tumor mean volumes and more measurements taken among participants.  While Nafitsol and Stelasyn were similar to Placebo results having little to no effect on tumor volume.  The largest tumor volume variance was with the Ketapril demonstrating inconsistency in effects of treatment.  
Pvalue of analysis between mouse weight and tumor volume was very low.  The pearson coffiecient was 0.84 also demonstrating a positive correlation.
